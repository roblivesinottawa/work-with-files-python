Yodel grew up in a family of singers and loud talkers and could never get a word in edgewise. Then his vast talent for yodeling emerged. Now he performs to adoring fans throughout the world, and always has the loudest voice at the dinner table. Incidentally, he's also a loud proponent of net neutrality, and spends countless hours moderating an internet forum devoted solely to that subject.
